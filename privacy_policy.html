            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>CV GIME does not require authentication or any login. All information you enter—names, email addresses, resume details—is stored locally on your device. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or retain any personal data on external servers.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>All data resides locally; its security depends on your device. Please ensure your device is protected and consider backing up your files responsibly.</p>
